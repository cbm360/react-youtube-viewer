## What I Learned
- JSX- this was my first introduction to JSX, honestly at first I was pretty resistant,
but by the end of the project I found myself really enjoying it.
- ES6 function syntax- I have used this on small projects in the past, but good refresher
because my recent projects have not been in ES6.
- Understanding React functional vs class components- good introduction, I will need to spend
some more time working with class components, specifically state.
- import a component- really easy import of componens makes modular code easy to accomplish. I
did start to enjoy JSX, and practicing writting small components and trying to isolate as much
functionality as possible.
- render to DOM- learned that React has been split into two libraries React and ReactDOM. Intrigued
by the concept of buliding all components, then imorting them into index.js to be packaged together
and then rendered in the DOM.
- Use contructor in a class and set state- starting to get the hang of using state in class components.
- Update state using setState- learned to allways use setState and never explicitly declare state
outside of constructor.
- Passing callbacks to other components- practice passing callbacks from top level component down
two levels.  This could get a little funky if passing the callback any more than two levels.
